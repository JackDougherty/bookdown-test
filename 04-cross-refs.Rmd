## Cross-references test {-}

Method 1: Bookdown unique ID links to cross-ref chapters, sections, figures... do they still create extraneous and imprecise URLs?

let's jump to the [Notes chapter](#notes)

now let's jump to the [Notes subchapter](#subchapter)

now let's jump to the [Notes subchapter subsection](#subsection)

now let's jump to the [Sample interactive](#sample-interactive)


Method 2: the HTML method

jump to the [Notes chapter](notes.html)

jump to the [Notes subchapter](subchapter.html)

probably won't work but jump to the [Notes subchapter subsection](subsection.html)
