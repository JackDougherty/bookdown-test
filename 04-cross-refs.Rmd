# Cross-references test {#crossrefs}

Best method: cross-refs to HTML

jump to the [Notes chapter](notes.html)

jump to the [Notes subchapter](subchapter.html)

jump to Figure \@ref(fig:sample-static-png).

jump to Table \@ref(tab:left-table).

but you cannot jump to a non-header [Notes subchapter subsection](subsection.html)


Avoid using Bookdown unique ID links to cross-ref chapters and sections, because they still create imprecise URLs with extraneous hashtags

let's jump to the [Notes chapter](#notes)

now let's jump to the [Notes subchapter](#subchapter)

now let's jump to the [Notes subchapter subsection](#subsection)

now let's jump to the [Sample interactive](#sample-interactive)
