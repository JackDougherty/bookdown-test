# Chapter 1 interactive media tests

## Question {-}
How to embed video stream from CT Digital Archives into Bookdown, WITHOUT autoplay, regardless of whether the user's browser is set to block autoplay?

**BEFORE TESTING**: Make sure that your browser settings do NOT block autoplay content by default, since we cannot ensure that users will have same browser settings as developers.

## Background {-}
Here is an oral history video as displayed on the CTDA site, which does NOT autoplay:

https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172

Here is the CTDA MP4 video stream for that object, which runs AUTOPLAY in Chrome and FFox for Mac (and perhaps other browsers). CTDA says there is no setting to turn off autoplay from datastreams

https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4

The stream above also works with this "view" ending:

https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4/view

## Trying iframe solution {-}
Here is Bookdown code-chunk that displays CTDA video in web edition, static image in PDF edition, BUT CANNOT TURN OFF AUTOPLAY using the iframe method, even if I add "?autoplay=0" or "?autoplay=false" to the end of the src string, as suggested in Stackoverflow further below.

(ref:ctda-sample-video) Here's a sample CTDA video caption, with option to add Markdown link and footnote.

```{r ctda-sample-video, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:ctda-sample-video)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4?autoplay=false") else knitr::include_graphics("images/2014-lumpkin-mae-willie-screenshot.png")
```

Question: is there a way to add a "no autoplay" command to the iframe through jQuery in the custom-script.html?


## Trying HTML5 video tag solution {-}
Here's a solution using the [HTML5 video tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp), which simply says NOT to insert "autoplay".

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
    <source src="https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:191/datastream/MP4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

The HMTL5 video tag solution stops autoplay, but it is NOT ideal for Bookdown-generated books because:

-  Bookdown/knitr does not *appear* to support the HMTL 5 video tag in the same way as it supports knitr::include_url. I could submit a request to Bookdown to support HTML5 video tag, but it's not likely to happen soon....
- This means that I cannot use Bookdown built-in support for figures using the HMTL5 video tag, such as:
  - the if-else statement in the R code-chunk that places the interactive iframe in HTML and the static floating image in the PDF, but the same caption for both
  - figure auto-numbering, such as Figure 1.2, 1.3, etc.

## Trying iframe solution with short video clip, stored locally 
(ref:sample-clip) Here's a sample local video clip caption, with option to add Markdown link and footnote.

```{r sample-clip, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:sample-clip)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("images/BernsteinSimon2011clip.mp4") else knitr::include_graphics("images/2014-lumpkin-mae-willie-screenshot.png")
```


## Best workarounds, so far {-}
1. Use HTML5 video tag, manually insert a caption, ignore missing figure number, and ignore that this doesn't work in the PDF version.
2. Upload full video to CTDA for historical preservation, and insert only a short video clip of relevant portion to Vimeo or YouTube, then insert the latter in Bookdown with iframe. Since Vimeo/YouTube clips do NOT autoplay, this will work with R code-chunk method above.


## Example of Vimeo video clip in web edition (no autoplay), with static image in PDF edition, {-}
(ref:vimeo-sample-video) Here's a sample Vimeo caption, with option to add Markdown links and footnote.

```{r vimeo-sample-vimeo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:vimeo-sample-video)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("https://player.vimeo.com/video/27299734") else knitr::include_graphics("images/2011-walsh-debra.jpg")
```
