Testing... How to embed video from CT Digital Archives into Bookdown without autoplay?

Here is an oral history video as displayed on the CTDA site, which does NOT autoplay:

https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172

Here is the CTDA MP4 video stream for that object, which runs AUTOPLAY in Chrome and FFox for Mac (and perhaps other browers). CTDA says there is no setting to turn off autoplay from datastreams

https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4

The stream above also works with this "view" ending:

https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4/view

Here is Bookdown code-chunk that displays CTDA video in web edition, static image in PDF edition, BUT CANNOT TURN OFF AUTOPLAY, even if I add

(ref:ctda-sample-video) Here's a sample CTDA video caption, with option to add Markdown link and footnote.

```{r ctda-sample-video, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:ctda-sample-video)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4") else knitr::include_graphics("images/2014-lumpkin-mae-willie-screenshot.png")
```
