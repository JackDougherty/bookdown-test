# Table test {#table}

**Table TBA: Title Here (and insert blank line before table begins)**

| Much Much Longer Header | Short Header | Short Header |
|:---------|:---|:---|
| Use left-colons to left-justify text content | Less  | Here |
| Use more hyphens to grant more space to some columns | Less | Here |


**Table TBA: Title Here (and insert blank line before table begins)**

| Header1 | Header2 | Header3 |
|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| 123 | 456 | 789 |
| Use right-colons | to right-justify  | numerical content |
| Use equal hyphens | to grant similar space | to all columns |

Summary of image and table approaches <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204272/r-markdown-how-to-create-a-table-with-images-and-text-which-should-be-knitted-a>

testing kable here with built-in database

```{r table1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), caption = "Title enables auto-numbering and cross-refs", "pandoc")
```

Testing kable with manual input data via tibble data frame. See <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html>

```{r table2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table2 <- tibble::tribble(
        ~Images, ~Authors,
        1, "Alpha",
        2, "Beta"
)
knitr::kable(table2, caption = "Title enables auto-numbering and cross-refs", "pandoc")
```

Testing kable with tibble data frame text and images

```{r table3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table3 <- tibble::tribble(
        ~Images, ~Authors,
        'images/dougherty-jack.jpg', "Alpha",
        2, "Beta",
        3, "Omega"
)
knitr::kable(table3, caption = "Title enables auto-numbering and cross-refs", "pandoc")
```

Testing new Kable approach <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204272/r-markdown-how-to-create-a-table-with-images-and-text-which-should-be-knitted-a>


Testing Kable version
```{r table-images, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align = "center", results='asis'}

dat <- data.frame(
  Image = c(
    paste0("![](images/dougherty-jack.jpg)"),
    paste0("![](images/simpson-candace.jpg)")
  ),
  Description = c(
  "text about Jack that goes on and on and on, with several repeating clauses, and goes on and on and on and on, with several repeating clauses, and goes on and on and on and on, with several repeating clauses, and goes on and on and on and on, with several repeating clauses, and goes on and on and on and on, with several repeating clauses, and goes on and on and on and on, with several repeating clauses, and goes on and on and on and on. ",
  "Text about Candace that goes on and on and on, but shorter than above."
  )
)
library(knitr)
kable(dat, format = 'pandoc')
```

Backup version
```{r foo, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align = "center", fig.cap='(ref:foo-caption)', results='asis'}
library(stringi)
some_text <- stri_rand_lipsum(1)
some_text <- paste("**Image description**", some_text)
dat <- data.frame(
  Image = c(
    paste0("![](images/dougherty-jack.jpg)"),
    paste0("![](images/simpson-candace.jpg)")
  ),
  Description = c(
  some_text, # TEXT IMAGE 1
  some_text  # TEXT IMAGE 2
  )
)
library(knitr)
kable(dat, format = 'pandoc')
```

Comparison with Markdown table 
Markdown formatting: use colon to left-justify, and hyphens to set relative width (2 vs 10)
