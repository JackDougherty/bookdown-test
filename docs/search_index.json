["video.html", "1 Video Tests", " 1 Video Tests Problem: Video stream content from CT Digital Archives and Trinity Kaltura automatically runs in autoplay mode in web browsers, and I have not yet found a consistent way to block this from happening. BEFORE TESTING: TEST in both Firefox and Chrome for auto-play issue. Make sure that your browser settings do NOT block autoplay content by default, since we cannot ensure that users will have same browser settings as developers. Best solution so far: Upload relevant clip to YouTube to display as iframe in web edition, with static image in PDF/Word editions, with caption link and footnote to full video, uploaded for historical preservation to CTDA or Kaltura Image 1: Here’s a sample YouTube caption, with option to add Markdown links and footnote to full video at CTDA. Works: Kaltura HTML5 embed avoids autoplay, but is it still supported? …as shown below in 2.1. See additional oral histories with participants in the Sheff v O’Neill school desegregation lawsuit.2 Image 2: View the oral history video interview and transcript with Elizabeth Horton Sheff in 2011. Works but not properly formatted: Kaltura default embed code avoids autoplay …as shown below in 3.This is actually Anne Goldstein. Image 3: This is actually Anne Goldstein sample video. Issue Background Here is an oral history video as displayed on the CTDA site, which does NOT autoplay: https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172 Here is the CTDA MP4 video stream for that object, which runs AUTOPLAY in Chrome and FFox for Mac (and perhaps other browsers). CTDA says there is no setting to turn off autoplay from datastreams https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4 The stream above also works with this “view” ending, but also runs autoplay: https://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/islandora/object/120002:172/datastream/MP4/view Failed: CTDA iframe with autoplay=false Here is Bookdown code-chunk that displays CTDA video in web edition, static image in PDF edition, BUT CANNOT TURN OFF AUTOPLAY using the iframe method, even if I add “?autoplay=0” or “?autoplay=false” to the end of the src string, as suggested in Stackoverflow further below. Image 4: Here’s a sample CTDA video caption, with option to add Markdown link and footnote. Also tried but did not succeed in adding a “no autoplay” command to the iframe through jQuery in the custom-script.html Not Bookdown-friendly: HTML5 video tag solution Here’s a solution using the HTML5 video tag, which inserts user “controls” but omits “autoplay”. The HMTL5 video tag solution stops autoplay, but it is NOT ideal for Bookdown-generated books because: Bookdown/knitr does not appear to support the HMTL 5 video tag in the same way as it supports knitr::include_url. I could submit a request to Bookdown to support HTML5 video tag, but it’s not likely to happen soon…. This means that I cannot use Bookdown built-in support for figures using the HMTL5 video tag, such as: the if-else statement in the R code-chunk that places the interactive iframe in HTML and the static floating image in the PDF, but the same caption for both figure auto-numbering, such as Figure 1.2, 1.3, etc. Failed: iframe solution with short video clip, stored locally, with custom script - but it autoplays Image 5: Here’s a sample local video clip caption, with option to add Markdown link and footnote. An alternative method is to store the video locally and display with HTML5 video tags, with a custom-script to stop auto-play. But Bookdown does not recognize HMTL5, so no figure auto-numbering and captions will be displayed, and therefore not ideal, as described above.

["notes.html", "2 Notes chapter test", " 2 Notes chapter test Testing dynamic reference with footnote In addition its financial assets, Clark also praised Hartford’s abundant cultural riches. The nation’s best-known authors, Samuel Clemens (more commonly known as Mark Twain) and Harriet Beecher Stowe (whose best-seller, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, influenced the Civil War), both took up residence in the city, alongside many of their literary companions, editors, and publishers. In addition to serving as the state capital, Hartford prized its extensive libraries, museum, and hospital. “The Hartford school buildings are said to the finest in the State,” Clark added, and called special attention to his alma mater, Hartford Public High School, the second oldest in the nation, which also enjoyed “a reputation with all the leading colleges as one of the best of all the preparatory schools,” as shown in Figure 6.3 In fact, the education that young people received in the city’s public school system far surpassed what was available in the outlying rural towns, known today as the suburbs.
